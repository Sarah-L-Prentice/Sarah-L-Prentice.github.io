## Welcome to Sarah Louise Prentice's Homepage

I have recently entered the world of computer programming. Feel free to follow my projects and my progress using this page.

### About Me

- I am currently working as a Teacher in a Secondary School. I teach French and Maths. <br/>
- I also do group fitness classes such as Bodyattack and Bodypump in my spare time. <br/>
- In my free time I sometimes rock climb (mainly indoor). <br/>
- I am also trying to learn how to code and improve and broaden my ICT skills. This page has been dedicated for that purpose.<br/>
