## Welcome to Sarah Louise Prentice's Homepage

I have recently entered the world of computer programming. <br/>
Feel free to follow my projects and my progress using this page.

### About Me

I am currently working as a Teacher in a Secondary School. I teach French and Maths. I also do group fitness classes such as Bodyattack and Bodypump. In my free time I sometimes rock climb (mainly indoor) and am trying to learn how to code and improve and broaden my ICT skills.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sarah-L-Prentice/Sarah-L-Prentice.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
