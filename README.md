I have recently entered the world of computer programming. :octocat: <br/>
Feel free to follow my projects and my progress.

### About Me :dancer: :muscle: :computer: 
```
- I am currently working as a Teacher in a Secondary School. I teach French and Maths. 
- I also do group fitness classes such as Bodyattack and Bodypump in my spare time.
- In my free time I sometimes rock climb (mainly indoor). 
- I am also trying to learn how to code and improve and broaden my ICT skills. 

This page has been dedicated for the purpose of furthering and documenting my career in ICT.
